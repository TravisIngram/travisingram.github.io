## Purpose

The life cycle of a given idea is usually pretty short.  At least mine are.  Primarily because, up until now, the only method I had to capture and save them was a rarely revisited OmniFocus view.  Outside of that, I've had nothing in place to capture, save, and review them.

I want to change that.  I am going to try to use this entry as a way to track ideas, from formulation to execution.  I also plan to explore some of the different subject areas that I find interesting and any associated resources that I come across.

For example, I mentioned [elsewhere](http://travisingram.github.io/2014-07-23-initial-commit.html) that I write a lot.  Which means I have a lot of text files laying around.  I’d like to build a command line app to search, parse, and analyze those files.  I think it’d be a fun and useful learning experience.
