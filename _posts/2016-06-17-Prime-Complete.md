My last public post was dated February, 8th.  There, I outlined the program that I had chosen to undertake and some of the things I hoped I'd be able to accomplish as well as some of the things that I feared.  For the most part, my fears proved unfounded and as I was able to complete what I had hoped I would complete.  So in that sense, I'm happy with the outcome.  But I still have a lot of work left to do, a lot of things left to learn.  Which I understood going in, so doesn't come as any big shock or surprise.

My focus at this point is finding a job.  While I certainly wish that I had a something lined up, I don't.  Not yet anyway.  It's a process like anything else and will take some time.  But I have the necessary skills and feel like I could make a meaningful contribution to a team if given the chance.  In the mean time, I'll continue to  push my learning and work on personal projects.  I'll keep reaching out to my peers and attending meet-ups in the area.  I've already been in contact with a number of companies and am looking forward to continuing those conversations in the coming weeks.  I'm confident that I'll find something soon.  It should be interesting.

### Private Posts

As I've mentioned in the past, I write every day.  The intent of this site was to have a place where I could put development related posts.  A place where I could talk about what I was learning and the projects that I was working on.  I've written about such things, but I haven't actually posted them.  I'm now considering going back and adding a few of them in.  There's a lot of material that I could share, but have been somewhat hesitant to do so.  Learning can be messy, and putting that process out there is a little scary.  But folks I've asked have encouraged me to do so anyway, so I think I will.  Although maybe with a bit of editing thrown in.  So that'll be something to look forward to.  As always, we'll see how it goes.
