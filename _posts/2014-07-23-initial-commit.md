### Purpose

I write everyday.  Informally, privately, but everyday.  The tools are simple, just a blank plain text file and the site [750words.com](http://750words.com).  I completed my first entry of 772 words on June 15th, 2011. Since then, I’ve added an additional thousand or so entries and recently passed one million words.  Which is a little crazy, I admit.  But when viewed as a habit or practice, a method to sort and make sense of the day, I think it’s worthwhile, valuable even.  Which is why I keep at it.

I created this site to act as something of a counter, to balance what is effectively an extension of my own internal dialogue.  I wanted to have a place to talk publicly and a little more formally about the various projects that I'm thinking about or working on.  I hope that by documenting the process, I’ll better understand the problem and potential solutions.

That’s the goal, anyway.  It's a little sparse at the moment, but I'll be addressing that in the very near future.

We’ll see how it goes.
