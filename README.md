My development related posts will live here.

I've set up this repository to make use of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

The layout I choose was [Poole](http://demo.getpoole.com/), created by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).  It's quite minimal while still
retaining or enabling some basic customization.  I hope to add a few things in
the very near future.  If at some point I find I need additional features, there
are two very nice variants, [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) and [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com).
