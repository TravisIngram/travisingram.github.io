### Learning and Software Development Analogy

The world of software development is incredibly diverse. Trying to provide students a solid foundation on which to build and grow their understanding is an incredibly challenging task to undertake.  Regardless of where you start or the material you choose to present, there will be gaps, areas that simply canâ€™t be covered.  In fact, acting as a guide, deciding what is relevant and keeping students focused, is arguably one of the most important tasks of an instructor.

There is a balance to be struck, though, a need to maintain focus on the fundamentals required to move forward while still providing enough context that students understand how those concepts fit into the larger whole.  It can work much like a puzzle where the main goal is to connect a bunch of seemingly disparate pieces to make a coherent whole.  Helping people to recognize the similarities within individual pieces, how they share a color or a shape, and then using that knowledge to make the connections and build out specific areas and, eventually, the whole.

Context and connection.

That way,  what they look like or how they behave.  Show them that how those pieces come together, work together to create a similar class of item.  How those can then be used in conjunction with one another to create an object and so on.

### Moving Forward

Creating content based on ones current learning objective can be a useful strategy to stay connected and engaged with the process. Subsequently providing that material for others to review and comment will encourage discussion and benefit everyone involved.

### Current Location

Self assessment is a key factor in the learning process.  Being able to accurately gauge your current level of understanding as well as identify any gaps will make the time you spend learning that much more efficient.  In most fields of study there is an inherent hierarchy that can be systematically worked through to gain understanding.  There are numerous methods one can take when moving through the material.  The efficacy of these methods will vary by individual based on factors such as their learning style and motivation.
